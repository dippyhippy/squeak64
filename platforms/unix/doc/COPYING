Many of the files in this distribution are subject to the following
copyright conditions:

  @copyright@

NOTE: Files that do not contain the above notice are subject to the
      conditions contained in the individual files themselves.  In the
      absence of explicit copyright conditions they are subject to the
      conditions described in the file `LICENSE'.

NOTE: Significant source contributions from other people are always
      acknowledged in the individual source files.  Unless explicitly
      indicated otherwise, the above copyright notice applies to such code
      (without prejudice and strictly to protect the interests of the
      individual contributors) but makes NO REPRESENTATION about the
      authorship or the ownership of the contributed code.

NOTE: Where the conditions talk about a "Squeak virtual machine" (VM)
      or use "in the context of Squeak" they refer to any program capable
      of executing a Squeak image file (as supplied in an official Squeak
      distribution) or any other image file derived from a Squeak image
      file.

You are allowed to use (or modify for use) in a program that is not a
Squeak virtual machine (VM), or to create derivative works unrelated
to the Squeak virtual machine, any files that contain the above
copyright notice subject to the following restrictions:

1. You must make a copy of the file under a different name and then use
   only your renamed copy.  [This is to prevent any confusion that
   would be caused by distributing two or more incompatible versions of
   the "same" file.]

2. You must not modify the the copyright notice in your copy, except
   as described below.

3. In your copy you must replace the portion of the copyright notice that
   commences:

     This file is part of Unix Squeak

   with the following notice:

4. You must not remove any acknowledgements for code contributed by other
   authors from your copy of the file.

5. You must include the file `COPYRIGHT' in any source or binary
   distribution that includes, or is based on, one or more files modified in
   the above manner.

6. You can now use your copy in any way that you like, subject to its new
   copyright conditions, provided that you do not re-introduce the file
   into any distribution of Squeak.  [This is to prevent any part of Squeak
   itself from being contaminated with the GPL.]

I'm sorry if the above seems draconian, but I'm trying simply to ensure
that both the Squeak and non-Squeak communities obtain the maximum benefit
from the software in this distribution.
